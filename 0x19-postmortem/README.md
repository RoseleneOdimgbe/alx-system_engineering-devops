* Duration: The outage occurred from 10:00 AM to 12:30 PM on April 5th, 2024 (UTC).
* Impact: The outage affected the authentication service, causing users to experience login failures and inability to access secured resources. Approximately 30% of users were unable to log in during the outage
* Root Cause: The root cause of the issue was identified as a misconfiguration in the authentication service's database connection pool settings.

## Timeline:
* 10:00 AM: The issue was detected when users started reporting login failures.
* 10:05 AM: Engineers received monitoring alerts indicating a spike in failed authentication requests.
* 10:10 AM: Initial investigation focused on checking server logs and network connectivity.
* 10:30 AM: Misleading assumption made that the issue could be related to a recent deployment.
* 10:45 AM: The incident was escalated to the DevOps team for further investigation.
* 11:00 AM: DevOps team identified the misconfiguration in the database connection pool settings as the root cause.
* 11:30 AM: The misconfiguration was corrected, and the authentication service was restarted.
* 12:00 PM: Verification tests conducted to ensure the issue was resolved.
* 12:30 PM: Services fully restored, and monitoring confirmed no further anomalies.

## Root Cause and Resolution:
* Root Cause: The misconfiguration in the database connection pool settings caused the authentication service to exhaust available connections, leading to login failures.
* Resolution: The misconfiguration was corrected by adjusting the database connection pool settings to ensure an adequate number of connections were available. Additionally, monitoring was enhanced to provide early detection of similar issues in the future.
## Corrective and Preventative Measures:
* Improve configuration management practices to prevent similar misconfigurations in the future.
* Implement automated testing of critical service configurations to detect issues before deployment.
## Task List:
* Conduct a thorough review of all service configurations to identify and correct any potential misconfigurations.
* Enhance monitoring and alerting systems to provide real-time notification of service anomalies.
* Develop and implement automated deployment pipelines with integrated testing to ensure configuration changes are properly validated before deployment.
* Schedule regular training sessions for engineering teams to enhance awareness of best practices for configuration management and troubleshooting.

## Issue Summay:
* Duration: The great authentication apocalypse struck our systems from 10:00 AM to 12:30 PM on April 5th, 2024 (UTC).
* Impact: The authentication service decided to take a coffee break, leaving users stranded at the login gates. Approximately 30% of users found themselves locked out of their accounts, pondering life's mysteries while staring at error messages.
* Root Cause: The mischievous gremlins of misconfiguration snuck into the authentication service's database connection pool settings, causing chaos and confusion.
